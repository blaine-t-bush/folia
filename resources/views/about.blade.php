<h1>About</h1>

<p>Parvifolium is the name of a number of plant species, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccinium_parvifolium">red huckleberry</a> (<em>Vaccinium parvifolium</em>) which is common in the Pacific Northwest. The name is derived from Latin <em>parvus</em>, meaning small, and <em>folium</em>, meaning leaf.</p>

<p><em>Folium</em> can also refer to the leaf of a book. In that sense, a small leaf is a bite-sized amount of reading. Unfortunately, to my knowledge there is no Latin word for blog.</p>

<p>Parvifolium is the website and playground of Blaine Bush.</p>
