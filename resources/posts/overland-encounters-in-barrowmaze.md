# Title
Overland Encounters in Barrowmaze

# Summary
Barrowmaze is a great megadungeon, but my players are more interested in wilderness exploration and overland adventures. I created random encounter tables to layer flavor and interesting scenarios onto the region's most common monsters.

I'm running a [Whitehack](https://whitehackrpg.wordpress.com/) game which originally focused on [Barrowmaze](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/139762/Barrowmaze-Complete), but which has slowly morphed into a series of small adventures anywhere but the eponymous megadungeon.

To keep things exciting when wandering the wilds, I've developed a few tables of random encounters. The goal here is to provide interesting encounters which are focused on a few specific factions and creature types, rather than sprawling tables of unrelated monsters. Each entry should have a built-in scenario. I don't want my players to encounter 1d6 bandits--I want them to encounter 1d6 bandits *doing something*.

For context, I like to use a modified form of the [overloaded encounter die](http://www.necropraxis.com/2014/02/03/overloading-the-encounter-die/). For overland travel, it looks like this:

| 1d6 | RESULT |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Encounter |
| 2 | Spoor |
| 3 | Hazard |
| 4 | Weather |
| 5 | Vignette |
| 6 | Location |

Like many OSR games, this leads to an encounter on a roll of 1. The difference is that something always happens, even on other results.
- **Spoor** is a hint of an upcoming encounter, like the scream of a mountain lion echoing through the hills, giant spiders' cobwebs, or the skeletal remains of a troll's meal. Roll for an encounter. That determines what the next encounter will be and what the spoor should hint at.
- **Hazard** is an encounter, but not with creatures. It should include things like pits of quicksand, hard-to-cross raging rivers, and intoxicating poppy fields.
- **Weather** is straightforward. Roll to determine a shift in the weather.
- **Vignette** is more of a scene than a hazard or encounter. Things like a mysterious old man selling "magical" beans or a witch flying across the night sky. I take a lot of inspiration from fairy tales and [d4 Caltrops's Wilderness Hexes](https://blog.d4caltrops.com/2018/03/wilderness-hexes-version-10.html).
- **Location** gives a chance to find an interesting place off the beaten path: an abandoned village, a dragon's lair, an enchanted fairy ring, and so forth.
