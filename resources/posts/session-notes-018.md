# Reminders
Interesting loot
- Two skulls etched with black triangles. They explode when shattered.
- An ancient tablet, covered with dark runes. It emits an eerie cold. It has not been read.
- A silver dagger, magical and engraved. Its nature is not fully known.
- Four right-hand gloves of velvet, embroidered with demonic eyes and a fanged maw.
- Two bags of giant spider silk, harvested by Valeron and his men. Each bag is enough to make two big things (tent, set of clothes, sleeping bag, &c) or four small things (rope, sling, backpack, &c). Vina, wife of Hendon the miller, is a skilled weaver and has offered her services.
- Messenger bag full of letters bound for Ironguard Motte.

Hirelings
- Sir Lucian has his squire, Gurney Floss, armed and armored as a knight.
- Gilgamesh has Joe, who prefers to be called Dragonlord. He holds torches.

From last time
- Debt! I believe Lucian has cleared his name but Gilgamesh still owes a bit to Huffnpuff?

# Possible Happenings
- A group of armed soldiers approach.
    - 4 soldiers (HD 2, AV 12, ST 7, AC 4 or 5); chainmail; two with halberds (1d6+1, reach), two with shields and sword (1d6+1).
    - They are sent by Lord Ironguard who wishes to speak with them.
    - If the party agrees, the soldiers take their weapons, escort them to Ironguard Motte and Lord Ironguard greets them.
    - If the party doesn't agree, the soldiers insist. They won't draw first blood, but they will respond to force with force.
- Lord Ironguard wants a group of adventurers to retrieve an ancient sword.
