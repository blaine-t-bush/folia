# Reminders
Interesting loot
- Two skulls etched with black triangles. They explode when shattered.
- An ancient tablet, covered with dark runes. It emits an eerie cold. It has not been read.
- A silver dagger, magical and engraved. Its nature is not fully known.
- Four right-hand gloves of velvet, embroidered with demonic eyes and a fanged maw.
- Two bags of giant spider silk, harvested by Valeron and his men. Each bag is enough to make two big things (tent, set of clothes, sleeping bag, &c) or four small things (rope, sling, backpack, &c).

Hirelings
- Sir Lucian has his squire, Gurney Floss, armed and armored as a knight.
- Gilgamesh has Joe, who prefers to be called Dragonlord. He holds torches.

From last time
- Debt?
