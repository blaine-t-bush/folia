# Reminders
Interesting loot
- Two skulls etched with black triangles. They explode when shattered.
- An ancient tablet, covered with dark runes. It emits an eerie cold. It has not been read.
- A silver dagger, magical and engraved. Its nature is not fully known.
- Four right-hand gloves of velvet, embroidered with demonic eyes and a fanged maw.
- Two bags of giant spider silk, harvested by Valeron and his men. Each bag is enough to make two big things (tent, set of clothes, sleeping bag, &c) or four small things (rope, sling, backpack, &c).

Hirelings
- Sir Lucian has his squire, Gurney Floss, armed and armored as a knight.
- Gilgamesh has Joe, who prefers to be called Dragonlord. He holds torches.

From last time
- Gilgamesh is in 500gp debt to HHR Huffnpuff at 25% per week
- Sir Lucian is in 500gp debt to Krothos Ironguard

# Events
- The gang nicks some dice from the Foul Pheasant.
- Gilgamesh curses the dice for one day so whenever they're covered, the faces change, and those who saw them rationalize the change (e.g. "I must've bumped them", "Guess I didn't get a good look").
- Sir Lucian takes out a loan from HHR Huffnpuff for 500gp at 25% per week.
- The gang takes the dice back to the Foul Pheasant and waits for Krothos Ironguard to show up to play at his usual seat.
- He shows up and they begin a game: Tuck, Lucian, Gilgamesh, and Krothos.
- Tuck is out when the buy-in reaches 500gp.
- Krothos and Gilgamesh are out when the buy-in reaches 700gp. Lucian wins.
- But during the course of play, the gang took out more loans from Huffnpuff:
	- Tuck took out 100gp
	- Gilgamesh took out 450gp
	- Lucian took out 600gp
