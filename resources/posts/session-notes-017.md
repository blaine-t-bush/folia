# Title
Session Recap: Barrowmaze #17

# Summary
The party makes its way to Ironguard Motte before returning to the Barrows for the first time in a while.

# Post
- Sir Lucian Dawnbringer
- Plithe and Wolf
- Friar Tuck
- Gilgamesh

## Leaving Helix
- Sir Lucian borrowed money from Friar Tuck and has cleared his debt to Krothos. Gilgamesh still owes money to Huffnpuff.
- The gang take their silk to Vina, the weaver. They give her about half the silk. Lucian asks her to make a sari, a potential gift for someone. Gilgamesh asks her to make a rope, a set of pajamas, and underwear. Plithe considers making a bowstring, which would grant +20 foot range, and +1 damage if paired with an equally rare bowstave material.
- Plithe tests the properties of the magical dagger on a chicken. It provides +1 AV and damage, and causes excessive bleeding, as if any cut had hit an artery.
- The gang sets off for Ironguard Motte to deliver the bag of letters they found when rescuing Yusef. During the trip, they spot a lizardfolk running through the brush, but otherwise it's uneventful.

## Visiting Ironguard Motte
- The town of Ironguard Motte is bigger than Helix, but can't be more than about 600 people. The town proper is surrounded by a wooden palisade, and the keep is on a raised earthworks surrounded by its own palisade and double gate.
- The gang heads for the first decent inn they see: the Leaky Barrel. They meet the barkeep Vandal Whitebeard, who offers to take and distribute the letters. He also mentions that the Lord Duke is hiring treasure hunters, which they'd heard before.
- They head to the keep, but it's late and they're turned away. They return the next day and are greeted by Ollis, the Lord Duke's steward.
- Ollis describes the job: retrieve the sword of an ancient heathen king from somewhere in the Barrows. The Lord Duke will pay 700 platinum coins for it.

### The Scholar
- Thomas, a scholar employed by the Lord Duke, offers up more information on the sword:
    - The sword, *Balmung*, once belonged to Siegfried, a king now a thousand years dead. The sword is said to burst with flame and was used by Siegfried to slay the dragon Fafnir.
    - Based on the age and the king's status, the sword is likely in one of the northwest barrow mounds, and not in the Barrowmaze itself.
    - *Balmung* is both a powerful weapon and a status symbol. Its ownership would lend further legitimacy to the Lord Duke's claims and desires of expansion.
    - The Lord Duke has a cousin who was exiled to Florin some twenty years ago.
- Thomas also offers further assistance:
    - He identifies the magical dagger as being from a similar time period as *Balmung*.
    - He identifies a potion in the party's possession as having the ability to produce a fiery shield when the imbiber is struck.
    - He offers to research the ancient tablet, which will take some time.

## Back to the Barrows
- The journey back to Helix is uneventful, except Plithe runs into Gil Green, a potion-apprentice from the Herbal Guild who's decent with a bow. Plithe hires him on.
- The party heads to the northwest barrow mounds. They break into a sealed mound (#6).
- Friar Tuck elects to create a Society of Barrow Delvers.

### Barrow Mound #6
- Inside are four marble statues of beautiful women with rubies for eyes, and one with black opals for eyes. Behind two of the statues are doors.
- Lucian opens one door, revealing a dozen giant rats, and Tuck closes it.
- Plithe gathers some brush and uses it to smoke out the rats. Later, the party scours the room and finds some coins (8pp, 1gp, 4sp, 12cp) and three arcane scrolls in a tube. They burn the nest.
- In the other room, Tuck discovers a pit trap with a venomous mechanical snake at the bottom. They plan to come back later to capture it.
- On an obsidian altar sit two jackal statues of solid gold. The party carefully takes them.
- The party topples one of the ruby-eyed statues before prying out all 8 of the rubies.
- Tuck discovers a potential trap in the opal-eyed statue. The party topples it from afar, releasing poisonous gas. It dissipates eventually and they pry out the opals.
