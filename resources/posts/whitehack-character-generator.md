## Character Basics
Attributes are rolled 3d6 in order. Class is selected from the base *Whitehack* classes, and so does not include the Brave or Fortunate classes. Hit points are rolled based on class, and attack value, saving throw, and slot count are calculated.

## Groups
Every character is given a vocation. This is selected at random from a long list. Each character is also given affiliations until all of their groups are filled. Most characters have two groups, and so will have one vocation and one affiliation, but characters with low attribute scores can receive bonus affiliation groups. Affiliations are also selected at random from a list.

## Slots
Depending on class, slots are determined in different ways. Strong characters have only one slot, and it's filled with one of that class's abilities from their fixed list of eight options. Deft and Wise characters, on the other hand, have more flexibility in their slots.

Deft characters can attune themselves to an item, person, or animal. Items include both weapons and less combat-focused objects, such as a crystal ball or a dice set. Animals, such as Bennet the mule, are randomly generated from a modest list. People are given a name and vocation from the same list as full characters.

Wise characters perform miracles, which encompass all types of magic, supernatural abilities, extraordinary science, and so forth. Miracles are generated from a laundry list of prefixes, primary components, suffixes, and a few predetermined options.

## Equipment
As a houserule, characters have a number of inventory slots equal to their strength or constitution scores, whichever is greater. Randomly generated characters begins with a set of armor, a melee weapon, and a ranged weapon determined at random, plus food, water, torches, coins, and some container. Remaining items are selected randomly while obeying the inventory slot restriction.
